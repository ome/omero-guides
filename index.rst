OMERO.iviewer
=============

We introduce
OMERO.iviewer, a 2D viewer which can
open and browse multi-t, multi-z and multi-channel images and allows to
draw and edit Regions of Interest (ROIs) and perform some rudimentary image analysis.
It also offers the ability to view several images at the same time and synchronize the
view. For more information, see https://github.com/ome/omero-iviewer.
