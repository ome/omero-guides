 * Create and manage Groups and Users.
 * Import data for others.
 * Import large or heterogeneous data for others.
 * Manage data for others.
 * Set up OMERO for publication of data.
 * Get users started.

Get users started
-----------------

Here we describe how to get users started. This is a walkthrough for a facility manager in charge of introducing new users to OMERO.

Step-by-Step
------------

#. Create the new user in OMERO and add them to the appropriate group(s) in OMERO. Consult the user and group creation sections of :doc:`introduction/docs/group-user-management`. In case your OMERO.server is set up for synchronization of logins with your institutional login system (LDAP), look for ``Managing LDAP Users`` in :doc:`introduction/docs/group-user-management`.

#. Explain to the user the basics of Group and User system in OMERO, drawing their attention to the importance of logging into the correct group when importing data. The user sets then their ``default group`` in OMERO correctly, as explained in :doc:`introduction/docs/group-user-management`, or you do it for the user.

#. Point the new user to the section explaining how to install and import data into OMERO using a Desktop client :doc:`upload/docs/import-desktop-client`.

#. Point the new user to the basic workflow example :doc:`example`. This will give them hints about the basic steps usually done when working with OMERO and how to go through them.

#. Explain to the user the data management and annotation possibilities in OMERO, as highlighted in :doc:`introduction/docs/data-management` and :doc:`introduction/docs/annotate`. 

#. Consult with the user the analysis possibilities when using 3rd party tools with OMERO, as listed in :doc:`external_tools`.

#. Mention :doc:`figure/docs/index`. This will help to raise the usage of OMERO in your institution.
