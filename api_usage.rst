OMERO Application Programming Interfaces
========================================

The OMERO Application Programming Interface (API) allows clients to be written in Java, Python, R, C++ or MATLAB.
In this section we show how to set up the various libraries and
use a combination of Jupyter notebook and scripts to demonstrate how to use the APIs.
